We will pick all the customer ids from customer tables grouping it by customer id. 
We will add a having clause to only pick those ids where the count of unique product keys for the customer id is equal to the count of product key from product table. 

```
select customer_id from customer
group by customer_id
having count(distinct(product_key)) = (select count(product_key) from product)
```
