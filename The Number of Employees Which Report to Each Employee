We will apply self join to get the name of the manager. Rest of the required columns we can get from employee table by using group by and having. 

```
select employee.reports_to as employee_id, manager.name, count(employee.reports_to) as reports_count, ROUND(avg(employee.age), 0) as average_age
from employees employee inner join employees manager
on employee.reports_to = manager.employee_id
group by employee.reports_to
having count(employee.reports_to) > 0
order by manager.employee_id
```
