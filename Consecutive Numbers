You can use where and in clauses to get the cunsecutive numbers. See below query:

select distinct num as ConsecutiveNums 
from logs where (id+1, num) in 
(select id, num from logs 
 where (id+1, num) in 
 (select id, num from logs)
)
Or you can also use self joins to get the required result as:

select distinct l1.num as ConsecutiveNums from logs l1
inner join logs l2 on l2.id = l1.id + 1
inner join logs l3 on l3.id = l2.id + 1
where l1.num = l2.num and l2.num = l3.num
First Approch is fater.
